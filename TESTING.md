## **Known Bugs**

### **Map Loading Time**
- **Issue:** Due to the large number of properties and the creation of markers for each one, the map takes a long time to load and re-renders can be slow. This delay can impact the user experience, especially when browsing properties on the map.
- **Workaround:** No current workaround for the loading time. However, efforts are underway to optimize the performance for faster loading and smoother interactions.

### **Map to Image Toggle**
- **Issue:** On the full details page of a property, there is an option to toggle between image and map view. However, Streamlit sometimes needs to rerun the page to update session state variables so that they take effect in specific components. Due to the details page being a modal, a potential rerun causes the modal to close, resulting in a poor user experience. Additionally, the page does not toggle back from map view to image view as expected.
- **Workaround:** A 1px wide placeholder Folium map initialization forces the necessary rerun, ensuring the session state updates correctly **without closing the modal**.

## **Future Implementations**

### **1. Implement Clustering for Markers**
- **Description:** To improve map performance and reduce the number of markers that need to be loaded at once, marker clustering will be implemented. This will group nearby markers together into a single cluster to improve load time and enhance the map interaction, especially for large datasets.
- **Expected Outcome:** By clustering markers, the map will load faster and the user experience will be much smoother, with improved responsiveness and minimal re-rendering issues.

### **Lighthouse**

The website has been tested using [Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) to test individual pages on:

- Performance - how does the page perform on loading?
- Accessibility - is the website accessible to all users?
- Best Practices - Does the code follow best practices?
- SEO - Is the pages optimized for search engines?

  An example of the Lighthouse results on both Chrome and Opera Browser at the Guilty Sheep movie card page is shown below:

  ![Lighthouse-chrome](media/chrome-lighthouse.png)
  ![Lighthouse-opera](media/opera-lighthouse.png)

  Results varied depending on browser, but wesite perfrmace seems to be low. Based on the lighthouse performance analysis it seems that Streamlit Cloud deployment maybe causeing the performance drop
